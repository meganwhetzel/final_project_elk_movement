# Elk Movement {#chapter4}

I had a large number of elk to work with so I wanted to plot the coordinates of a subset of them to compare their movement in relation to each other and the study area. 

Generally, elk travel many kilometers for seasonal migration and as part of their home range - seasonally they can average about 100 km! I aimed to see how elk are moving individually and whether their paths cross with other elk while moving through their home ranges.

## Plotting an elk's path

I isolated one elk, number 878, and plotted its telemetry points:
```{r 878, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  filter(elk_id == "878") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = elk_id)) +
  geom_path(color = "turquoise") +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Most elk appeared to have interesting patterns of movement so I plotted a few more 
individually to see how they looked:

Elk 1622:
```{r 1622, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
    filter(elk_id == "1622") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = elk_id)) +
    geom_path(color = "slateblue") +
    labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
```
  
Elk 300:

```{r 300, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  filter(elk_id == "300") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = elk_id)) +
  geom_path(color = "palevioletred") +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
  
Then, I chose 6 more elk to compare the movements of with elk 878, 1622, and 300:

```{r multi, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  filter(elk_id %in% c("1622", "878", "300", "611", 
                       "609380B", "32439", "179", "1996", "609377A")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = elk_id)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", color = "Elk ID") +
  facet_wrap(~ elk_id) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "rocket") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

Just simply looking at these paths created by the telemetry points doesn't really tell us much about the elk's decisions. What locations did they use the most?

## Heatmap of elk landscape usage

I created a heat map of a few elk to really see where on the landscape elk were spending the most time. 

Elk 878:
```{r hex878, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  select(elk_id, longitude, latitude) %>% 
  filter(elk_id == "878") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude,
  )) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "inferno") +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", 
       title = "Heatmap of Most Used Locations for Elk 878") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

Elk 1622:
```{r hex1622, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  select(elk_id, longitude, latitude) %>% 
  filter(elk_id == "1622") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude,
  )) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "inferno") +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", 
       title = "Heatmap of Most Used Locations for Elk 1622") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```
  
And again, elk 300:
```{r hex300, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  select(elk_id, longitude, latitude) %>% 
  filter(elk_id == "300") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", 
       title = "Heatmap of Most Used Locations for Elk 300") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "inferno") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```

It seems as if elk 300 enjoyed 2 different areas within its home range and also traveled quickly between those 2 locations. 

  
Here are the heatmaps of the other 6 elk:
```{r fullheat, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  filter(elk_id %in% c("611", 
                       "609380B", "32439", "179", "1996", "609377A")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "inferno") + 
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude") +
  facet_wrap(~ elk_id) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```



Elk do appear to be utilizing different locations on the landscape than each other. However, this dataset would have been more useful if it also contained sex of the elk. I would have liked to compare male to female elk in terms of movement and size of home ranges because of differences in seasonal migration, caring for young, and utilizing resources.
