# Temperature {#chapter3}

I was interested in looking at the distribution of temperatures across the study
site, especially since it took place in southwestern Alberta and northern 
Montana; places where I would assume the weather is fairly mild in the summer and cold in the winter. 

I selected one elk, 1590, from the dataset to look at the ambient temperatures
it experienced over the course of its location points. I plotted it to show the range of
temperatures an elk has to live through on a yearly basis. 

```{r temp1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  select(temp_c, elk_id) %>% 
  filter(elk_id == "1590") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temp_c, fill = elk_id)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "salmon1") +
  labs(x = "Temperature (Cº)", y = "Count", 
       fill = "Elk ID") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

Then, I used the data from the same elk to create another plot with the frequency for each temperature.
```{r temp2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  select(temp_c, elk_id) %>% 
  filter(elk_id == "1590") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temp_c, fill = elk_id)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., group = 1), fill = "springgreen3") + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (Cº)", y = "Relative frequency", fill = "Elk ID") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
  
Luckily, the most frequent temperatures for the elk were between -3ºC to 12ºC or about 26ºF to 54ºF. 

I assumed temperatures would fluctuate largely due to seasonal changes but I was
surprised to see the wide range of temperatures that elk lived through on the 
study site. It looks like the elk experienced anywhere from -28ºC to around
30ºC! 

Finally, I took 8 other elk in addition to elk 1590 and plotted the temperatures they experienced.
```{r practice, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  select(temp_c, elk_id) %>% 
  filter(elk_id %in% c("1590", "786", "297", "609374A", "395", 
                       "609372A", "858", "843", "172")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = elk_id, y = temp_c, color = elk_id)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Temperature (Cº)", x = "Elk ID", 
       color = "Elk ID") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
  
Overall, it looks like elk experience a range of 0ºC to 10ºC on average with some high and low outliers!  


Because of the temperature extremes I noticed while plotting the previous graphs,
I created a new plot to show every elk and the maximum and minimum temperatures
recorded for each. I removed the 26 elk that had missing temperature data.
```{r temp, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
gps %>% 
  group_by(elk_id) %>% 
  mutate(max_temp = max(temp_c)) %>% 
  mutate(min_temp = min(temp_c)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(max_temp)) %>% 
  distinct(elk_id, max_temp, min_temp, temp_c) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = elk_id)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = max_temp, color = "darkred")) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = min_temp, color = "royalblue3")) +
  labs(x = "Elk ID", y = "Temperature (Cº)", color = "Elk ID") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```
  
The plot is a little overwhelming and doesn't tell us too much, but it is still interesting to see the temperature extremes (high and low) throughout the seasons in Alberta.
